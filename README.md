# PhantomAPI

> [!WARNING]
> PhantomAPI is an early-stage project and is under active development.

Treat configuration as executable.
PhantomAPI instantly launches a live API server directly from your OpenAPI specification with low overall overhead.
It provides coherent, database-like behavior, consistently resolving the same entities
regardless of whether they are accessed by ID, query, or association, while accepting updates during runtime.
